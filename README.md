## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS/SCSS
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- Creating a custom and responseive modal from scratch helped me understand designing them in a much better way.
- This was a very good practice for CSS grid and I also used this opportunity to design with the help of SASS/SCSS.

### Continued development

- The animation is done using basic JS since animation was not the priority in this project.
- So if I ever recreate this in React, I will use Framer Motion to smoothen the effects.
